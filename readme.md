#  CxLos11-Note-Taker

## Description
```
The motivation behind this project was to better understand how to use the local server, and how to make post and get requests. I built this project so that one can easily jot some notes down and then refer back to them later, as well as delete any old notes that are no longer needed. It solves the problem of forgetfulness that a lot of people have in this busy world where we are constantly on the go and have a lot of things to do, but maybe struggle with always remembering all those things. While working on this, I learned how to make requests to the server to retrieve and send data to make content populate on the web page.
